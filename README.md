# HW2_CSS_Bootstrap
HW2

- created an index/contact/portfolio.html 
- building out the index file first
    - added bootstrap style links
    - added nav bar

- Updated the meta data on the other pages
- Added links to contact and portfolio page
- Added same boilerplate styling to contact page as well as portfolio page

I am so lost right now....

- Added pictures to the portfolio page
- Added form to contact page
- Added a placeholder button to the contact page
- Changed directory structure because I could not load the page on gitlab
- reworked all relative links now that there is a directory structure that makes sense
